# Client listing

A component to display all the current clients. Comes with a header to add new clients or import a previously exported client.

The component has no "structure" to it, meaning it will always stretch to the full width of the container it is placed in.

## Usage

```jsx
import ClientListing from "components/ClientListing"

return <ClientListing />
```
